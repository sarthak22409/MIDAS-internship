SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION--
for speech recognition i used ffmpeg to change the dataset to monochannel and its frequency to 16000hz 
to extract the features from audios i used librosa and soundfile libraries of python features included mfcc(representation of power spectrum based on frequency,chroma to get 12 differennt pitch classes ,contrast(to differentiate between audio and noise) ,mel(Mel scale is a scale that relates the perceived frequency of a tone to the actual measured frequency. It scales the frequency in order to match more closely what the human ear can hear (humans are better at identifying small changes in speech at lower frequencies),


This is a Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier; it optimizes the log-loss function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent. Unlike SVM or Naive Bayes, the MLPClassifier has an internal neural network for the purpose of classification. This is a feedforward ANN model.
